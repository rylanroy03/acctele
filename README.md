# ACCTele (v1.2a)
### An open-source realtime telemetry project designed for Assetto Corsa Competizione
#### Created by Rylan Markwardt


ACCTele is designed to pull from the shared memory of Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC).
The program is currently a lightweight executable with plans to develop into a fully
fledged telemetry application with save functionality, modular interface, and clear
representation of data at the forefront.

In the interest of maintaining transparency, I will provide the ACC Shared Memory
documentation as part of the source code zip so that you may tweak it to your interests.
However, I cannot guarantee that the program will always be this easy to modify, and
in the future I may add a feature that allows you to disable certain portions of data
collection in order to lower its impact on the parent machine.
