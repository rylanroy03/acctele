# ACCTele (v1.3a)
### An open-source realtime telemetry project designed for Assetto Corsa Competizione
#### Created by Rylan Markwardt


ACCTele is designed to pull the shared memory from Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC).
The program is currently a lightweight executable with plans to develop into a fully-fledged 
telemetry application with the following:

 - save functionality
 - modular interface
 - clear representation of data

If you have any recommendations, please add them to the GitHub repo... however that
works. I'm new to GitHub. But I'll find it!

In the interest of maintaining transparency, I will provide the ACC Shared Memory
documentation as part of the source code zip so that you may tweak it to your interests.
However, I cannot guarantee that the program will always be this easy to modify, and
in the future I may add a feature that allows you to disable certain portions of data
collection in order to lower its impact on the parent machine.
